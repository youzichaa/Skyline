# Skyline-PPSQ
The source code is located in ./test/test_ring_skyline.cpp

## Introduction:

run the code:

`cd ./build/`

`cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=./install .. -DBUILD_TESTS=ON -DBUILD_NETWORKS=ON`

`cmake --build . --target install --parallel`

the "skyline-OT.o" file is generated. 

Please move to the "run" file:

`cd /build/bin/`

Note: To test the files, we prepared the relevant executables, where "skyline-OT-G" stands for model generation, ""skyline-OT-Q" for model query under synthetic datasets (where -T is for parallel execution), and ""skyline-OT-Qdo" for real datasets (where -T is for parallel execution). 
Moreover, we construct shell files where: 

1. "Pname" denotes the dataset by  (0 to 2, representing three datasetsï¼šcorr, anti, inde),
2. "Psize" denotes the size of the dataset (0 to 6, representing (10, 100, 1000, 3000, 5000, 7000, and 9000)),

## Run test example:

For example, run the command.

`nohup ./run.sh >output.txt 2>&1 &`

, the whole console output is stored in "output.txt".

## Other test

Since the other datasets exceed the 25M size limit of the "Github" website, we only uploaded "size=100" under synthetic datasets and "size=1000" under real dataset as open source material.

For the dataset under "size=1000":

1. You can execute individually the following command:`./skyline-OT-G r=1 p=9000 Pname=0 Psize=2 & ./skyline-OT-G r=2 p=9000 Pname=0 Psize=2`

   1. the test result is generated in the following file: ./test/out_A.txt, ./test/out_B.txt. For example:

      <img src="README.assets/image-20240415103614735.png" alt="image-20240415103614735" style="zoom:33%;" />

   2. the parameter result is stored in ./test/grid/Pname-Psize-*.csv

      <img src="README.assets/image-20240415103657971.png" alt="image-20240415103657971" style="zoom:33%;" />

2. You can also execute individually the following command:`./skyline-OT-Q r=1 p=9000 Pname=0 Psize=2 & ./skyline-OT-Q r=2 p=9000 Pname=0 Psize=2`

   1. the test result is generated in the following file: ./test/out_A_qua.txt, ./test/out_B_qua.txt

   2. The Skyline Mask (polynomials and hash functions) Time, SelectQua (quadrant) Query Time, Select (dynamic) Query  Time, and Communication are printed. For example:

      <img src="README.assets/image-20240415104127437.png" alt="image-20240415104127437" style="zoom:33%;" />
